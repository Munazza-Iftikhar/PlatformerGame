# 2D Platformer Game in Java

This is a 2D Platformer Game developed in Java.  
It uses the core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## **GAME FEATURES**

The game includes classic platformer mechanics:
- The player can move left, right, and jump, with gravity affecting motion.
- Platforms are static tiles that the player must navigate.
- Crabs act as enemies, patrolling and dealing damage on contact.
- There are multiple levels, each loaded from level data using 2D arrays.
- A scrolling background keeps the camera focused on the player.

## **GAME ARCHITECTURE**

The code is structured using multiple classes:
- The `Game` class manages the game loop and overall state.
- The `Player` class handles physics, input, and collisions.
- The `Enemy` class controls the crab (enemy) behavior.
- Levels are loaded using `LevelManager` and `Level`.
- `GamePanel` and `GameWindow` handle rendering and user input.

This project demonstrates my understanding of Java and object-oriented design in game development.  
It serves as a hands-on example of applying core programming principles in an interactive application.
